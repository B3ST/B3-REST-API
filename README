# B3 REST API Extensions

This plugin extends the [WP-API](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API) in order to retrieve data not yet handled by the official plugin, such as settings, menus and sidebars.

This plugin is under active development and should not be considered for production environments.

## Installation

1. Install the official [WP-API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/) plugin and activate it.
2. Clone the `B3-REST-API` repository into the _plugins_ folder of your WordPress install.
3. Navigate to _Plugins_ in the WordPress Admin, look for "B3 API Extensions" and activate it.
4. As with the WP-API plugin, the B3 API Extensions require pretty permalinks to be enabled.
